# E08a-Paddle-Ball
For this assignment, we used Godot to create our game. There are two moving components: the ball and the paddle. The paddle can be moved with the mouse and the ball will bounce off of the paddle, as well as the walls. If the ball hits a rectangle, then the rectangle will disappear. There are multiple rows of colored rectangles, which all interact with the ball.
